Hi, Iâ€™m Anurag Kumar Pandey! Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast from Nepal, currently living in Germany. I have always been curious about technology and enjoy learning how things work â€” especially in the world of software and IT systems.

Iâ€™m interested in web development and Iâ€™m learning to work with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve also started exploring tools like Git, React, and Node.js to build small projects and improve my problem-solving skills.

Besides coding, I like spending my free time doing photography, writing stories, and enjoying a good cup of coffee. My goal is to keep learning and growing in the tech world while working on creative and exciting projects.

Right now, Iâ€™m exploring more about web programming, DevOps, and the basics of AI and Machine Learning. I also want to get involved in open-source projects to learn from real-world examples.
